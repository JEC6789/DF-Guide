<br><br>


### Notes:
- To switch versions on Windows, you can use MCLauncher found in the 'files' folder. However, for most early versions, you'll need to do it on a mobile device.

- To access coordinates in older versions of Minecraft, you can use the "CoordinatesUnlocker" Texture Pack. This pack is designed for older versions that automatically enabled cheats when coordinates were activated.
<br><br>


### 0.2.0: (Android Exclusive Version)
- By placing Cactus or Ladders on snow layers, you can bypass the typical placement limitations, replacing them with snow. This allows cactus to be placed on grass and the creation of invisible ladders
<br>


### 0.4.0: (Android Exclusive Version)
- Red dye is obtainable via smelting red mushrooms, which allows for red dye in the output slot of a furnace

- Gravity blocks like Sand and Gravel do not fall when placed in mid-air

- Torches can be placed on the side of Fences, resulting in the torches being positioned mid-air. It is important to keep these torches placed on fences in unloaded chunks until later versions, as they randomly break in early versions

- Wooden slabs can be crafted which later on turn into "Fake Wood Slabs". These are the equivalent to Petrified Oak Slabs in Java and even share the same properties

- When a door is placed on farmland, the lower half of the door will break while the upper half remains

- When a hoe is used on dirt that is underwater, it will turn into farmland
<br>


### 0.5.0: (Android Exclusive Version)

- Any cake blocks that are placed, will convert to info_update2 in the next version. These blocks can be mined with any tool and will drop themselves

- When slabs are placed on the upper half and then destroyed, they keep their data and remain as "top slabs"

- Placing a slab adjacent to the world border and attempting to place a block that needs support (e.g. torches) on the side of the slab will result in the support block facing towards the world border
<br>


### 0.7.1: (Android Exclusive Version)

- All types of buckets can stack up to 64. To prevent them from breaking, place these buckets directly into a chest before updating
<br>


### 0.8.0: (Android Exclusive Version)
#### ** Loading a world creates a "players" folder in the world files

- In this version, item duplication is possible, and items can be stacked beyond their usual limits. To achieve this, you need to follow these steps: Open your world to LAN and connect with a second device. Alternatively, you can use apps like Parallel Space to run multiple instances of Minecraft simultaneously if you don't have a second device. After that, drop the items to the second device. After 10 seconds, relog on the host device. This will overstack everything you threw to your device. Place the duplicated items into a chest, and you will find their stack size increased significantly, usually exceeding 99. In some cases, the stack size may appear as negative, but it will still show as 99+ in the game

- Cacti can grow adjacent to other blocks

- Torches can be placed inside of paintings
<br>


### 0.8.0 alpha build 4: (Android Exclusive Version)

- Carpets can be placed underwater

- Logs can now be placed sideways. Mining these sideways logs drops invalid data value logs
<br>


### 0.9.0 alpha build 1: (Android Exclusive Version)
> [!NOTE]
> To update the old world to an infinite world, it can be done by editing the "generator:0" value in the level.dat to "generator:1" which changes the generation to infinite

- Furnaces that generate in villages currently are data value 0, and thus have no visible face
<br>


### 0.12.0: (Android Exclusive Version)
- Iron golems do not have knockback resistance
<br>


### 0.12.1: (Android Exclusive Version)
- Placing sponge underwater won't make it absorb any water

- Breaking Wall Signs, Standing Signs, Flower Pots, Skulls, Brewing Stands and Beds with Silk Touch will make them drop their tile variant instead of the normal variant

- When you rename an item using an Anvil, it adds anvil uses to the item, resulting in an increased cost for the item with each renaming
<br>


### 0.15.2.1: (Android Exclusive Version)

<br>


### 1.0.0.16:
- Mining a furnace while it is smelting with a silk touch pickaxe drops a lit furnace
<br>


### 1.1.5.0:
- Breaking Blocks while they are being moved with a Piston drops the Moving Block tile. A silk touch pickaxe with at least efficiency 4 is recommended for this
<br>


### Beta 1.2.0.2: (Android Exclusive Version)
- Water, flowing water, lava, and flowing lava tiles can be obtained through various setups of mining progress transfer. A block that is quick to mine and easily replaceable, such as snow, should be replaced with a liquid while holding left click with a silk touch tool, and the resulting liquid tile has a chance of dropping

<br>


### 1.2.6.55: (Android Exclusive Version)
- Any item from a crafting recipe can be obtained so long as the player has at least one ingredient for the crafting recipe. This bug can only be performed using the mobile UI. This works by first selecting a red crafting recipe from the recipe book. Then in the crafting interface, a valid recipe item can be selected, and then swapped with one of the ingredients outlined in red. This allows for not only item duplication, but also lingering potions of decay from the tipped arrow of decay crafting recipe

- Using the crafting recipe item swap, bows can be obtained from dispenser recipes and shovels obtained from boat recipes. These tools will have -32767 durability. After obtaining they must be combined with another low durability tool to prevent the value of -32767 rolling over to 0, and all negative durability values from -1 through -32766 are obtainable
<br>

### Beta 1.2.13.8: (Requires "Use Experimental Gameplay", Android Exclusive Version)
- Curse of Binding and Curse of Vanishing enchantments use the same id as Loyalty and Channeling respectively, and in future versions all curse enchantments will convert to their respective trident enchantment. This allows for channeling on any item that can be enchanted, and loyalty on any armor item that can be enchanted

- Impaling and Riptide enchantments currently use the same id as Curse of Binding and Curse of Vanishing enchantments respectively, and in future versions all impaling and riptide enchantments will convert back to their respective curse. This allows for curse of binding I-V and curse of vanishing I-III books and villager trades[x]
<br>


### 1.2.13.8 => 1.2.6.60: (Requires Downgrading²)
> [!CAUTION]
> BPC (Block Palette Corruption) may make your world unplayable if you don't have a beefy device! If you are stuck in the loading screen while trying to load the world, re-open minecraft.

- Loading a world in 1.2.13.60 and downgrading it to 1.2.6.60 will turn all sub-chunks with blocks inside them (air excluded) into chunks with random blocks. This can also load thousands of entities and tile entities, making it super laggy. These chunks have a random block palette and may have illegal block formations like crops or saplings on top of invalid blocks, or illegal blocks, such as Education Edition Blocks or Placed Creative Blocks

- Compound Creators can be Flowing Waterlogged
<br>


### Beta 1.2.14.2: (Android Exclusive Version)
- Flowers, saplings, and dead bushes can be waterlogged

<br><br>


### Beta 1.8.0.8: (Android Exclusive Version) 
- All double slabs can be obtained by mining their corresponding block form.
<br>


### 1.8.0:

<br>


### 1.9.0:
- Glass bottles can be put into brewing stands with a hopper

- Brewing potions alongside glass bottles adds a "wasJustBrewed:1" tag to the glass bottles. These glass bottles no longer stack with normal glass bottles
<br>


### Beta 1.11.0.1: (Android Exclusive Version)
- Updating slabs into this version will cause them to be converted into double slabs. All wood slabs, except for Petrified Oak Slabs, will not convert. In modern versions, these double slabs will turn into normal looking smooth stone slabs and red sandstone slabs, however, they cannot be placed down

- Fletcher villagers can sell maps
<br>


### 1.12.0:
#### ** Smelting cobblestone and other items[×] changes their damage value to 32767. However, any item with a damage value of 32767 will revert back to 0. You can keep such items by storing them in a shulker box and then destroying the box. Placing the box back down would also automatically reset their damage values to 0

#### ** Breaking leaves with silk touch will drop leaves that don't stack with each other. These can have a "update_bit" tag, "persistant_bit" tag, or both. Just like items with a damage value of 32767, these will revert to normal leaves in newer versions. You can use the same method mentioned above to store these safely without reverting
<br><br>


### 1.14.0:
- When using the Silk Touch enchantment on Red/Brown Mushroom Blocks and Mushroom Stems, they will drop Mushroom blocks with different NBT values and a different appearance

- Breaking nether sprouts will drop (invisible) nether sprout tiles
<br>


### 1.16.40:
> [!CAUTION]
> PDV: When performing Gravity Block Conversion, some gravity blocks may turn into blocks from Education Edition and picking those blocks up will crash your world!

> [!NOTE]
> If your menu is Glitched, you can use the 1.16.40 Menu Fix in the Texture Pack Folder

- Pistons can extend below y level 0

- Support blocks (e.g. vines, ladders) can be placed onto chains

- Endermen can pick up Warped and Crimson Fungus and they can place it on any full block

- Making gravity blocks fall into an end gateway and then relogging would transform those into random blocks. Notable glitched blocks obtained include: Creative Blocks (e.g. Command Blocks, Bedrock, Light Blocks), Unused Blocks (e.g. Smooth Stone Bricks, Smooth Purpur, Chiseled Purpur), Discontinued Blocks (e.g. Old Stonecutters, Nether Reactor Cores), Education Edition Blocks (e.g. Underwater Torch, Chemical Heat) and Miscellaneous Glitch Blocks, such as Glitched Anvils, which are distinguishable with the Discontinued Feature Tweaks Pack
<br><br>


### 1.16.40 => 0.6.0: (Requires Downgrading¹)
> [!NOTE]
> If your phone is crashing upon creating a world in 0.6.0, you can unzip the "Cross Dimension Chunk Template" zip file and move the extracted folder to "games > com.mojang > minecraftWorlds"
Note: this may be considered cheating because it does require you to move world files

- You can get cross dimension chunks (e.g. Overworld chunks in the end/nether) by following these steps:
  - Enter the end and stand at the coordinates: 115 100 149 in 1.16.40
  - Downgrade to 0.6.0 and create a world with the same seed as your 1.16.40 save
  - Move the db folder from 1.16.40 into the 0.6.0 world
  - Upgrade back to 1.16.40 and change to infinite before loading the world. (Crashes are expected to happen)
<br>


### 1.16.100:
- If you place a gateway block on the central pillar of the end fountain and the dragon perches on the fountain, the dragon will be frozen. Upon re-entering the end, an end gateway will appear where the dragon was, and the dragon will be free again. These end gateways teleport you to the spot where you manually placed the gateway block
<br>


### 1.16.201:
- Pushing End Crystals with a flying machine while summoning an ender dragon, will prevent them from updating. As a result, they will remain indestructible and permanently display the summoning beam

- If you punch an end crystal while summoning an ender dragon, and standing within the exit portal, you will be transported back to the overworld. As a result, you will find four beaming crystals at your exit portal, which are destructible. Please note that the number of crystals may vary, sometimes resulting in three crystals, depending on the speed at which you are sent back to the overworld

- Wandering Traders sell ink sacs with a damage value of 4

- Within Woodland Mansions, it is possible to obtain Leather Helmets enchanted with Efficiency 1, along with black glow sticks. The helmets can be located in a secret room containing a chest and a tree. This room is easily identifiable due to its blocked-off entrance, though the frame remains visible. On the other hand, finding the Glow Sticks can be quite challenging as they only appear in the rare "Fake End Portal" Room. Unlike the Helmet Room, there are no indicators to help locate it. To simplify the search for the fake portal room, you can use the Mansion Hider pack in the Texture Pack folder, which allows you to see through mansion walls. Both of these rooms can only appear on the mansion's first floor
<br>


### 1.16.220:
#### (*) Foxes can wear armor in this version, simply by dropping it to them. Using the Discontinued Feature Tweaks texture pack will make the armor visible

#### (*) Glowstone can be Dispensed onto hostile mobs that can wear armor, armor stands and players. To make Glowstone visible on entities, you can use the Discontinued Feature Tweaks texture pack

- Putting a minecart on a detector rail and pushing the rail with a piston keeps the rail powered even after the minecart is destroyed

- If you put non-full blocks like slabs into snow-covered flowers, the flowers won't break. This results in flowers that have non-full blocks inside them

- End Portals don't trigger Block Updates when activated. This allows for the creation of floating gravity blocks on top of end portals and other things like headless pistons and portal logged blocks

- Taking damage mid-air right before you land will give you absorption hearts. These absorption hearts are permanent and can be stacked up to 8 hearts

- When animals and villagers are bred, they use their current speed rather than their base speed. Therefore, if these animals are splashed with swiftness or slowness potions before breeding, their offspring will inherit be faster/slower than their parents. This breeding process can be repeated endlessly
<br>


### Beta 1.17.0.58: (Android Exclusive Version)
- Powder Snow Buckets can be obtained by placing cauldrons in snowy areas, which is required for the next few versions
<br>


### Beta 1.16.210.54: (Requires Experimental Mode and Downgrading², Android Exclusive Version)

<br>


### Beta 1.16.220.51: (Requires Experimental Mode and Downgrading², Android Exclusive Version) 
- All cut copper block variants that are placed down in this version will transform into Unknown blocks when updating. These Unknown Blocks will retain their original ID, "minecraft:cut_copper_block". You can also store these cut copper blocks in shulker boxes before updating
<br>


### Beta 1.17.0.50: (Android Exclusive Version)
- Powder Snow Blocks are obtainable by letting a wither destroy them
<br>


### Beta 1.17.0.52: (Android Exclusive Version)
#### ** Feeding axolotls will return a bucket with a damage value of 32767. Similar to other items with the same damage value, it needs to be stored in a shulker box
<br><br>


### Beta 1.17.0.52: (Android Exclusive Version, Requires Experimental Mode)
- All chunks that are loaded with the "Caves and Cliffs" experimental toggle will be elevated when updating. Any tile entity data in these chunks will be removed, which can result in things like empty mob spawners
<br>

### 1.17.0:
- By placing a block against the top side of an amethyst cluster, regardless of its size, and subsequently removing the supporting block, the shard will remain floating in mid-air. Once it is floating, you can also remove the other block

- Dispensing Powder snow into lit portals (specifically East or North facing portals) will split the portal, leaving behind portal blocks solely on the layer where the snow was placed

- Mining a lit Observer will keep its lit state in the inventory. Stacking lit obeservers with regular observers will revert them

- Paintings can overlap with Glow Item Frames, Signs, Banners, and Torches

#### (*) Vindicators can spawn from Patrols when the world difficulty is set to Hard. Making it possible to obtain Vindicator Patrol followers and Patrol Captains. Vindicator Patrol Captains can be distinguished from normal Vindicators with the Discontinued Feature Tweaks texture pack

- Big Dripleaf does not have any placement restrictions and can be placed on any block

- Glow Lichen can be placed on farmland and dirt paths

- Hanging Roots can be waterlogged

- Tying an axolotl to a fence or a wall and subsequently scooping the axolotl up will not remove the leashes from the Fences or Walls and the Axolotls will remain unattached and unable to be leashed

- Using Dispensers to remove water from Bubble Columns does not destroy the Bubble Column itself; instead, it simply removes the water and reverts it to a non-waterlogged state. This can also be used to make flowing waterlogged bubble columns

#### \* Leashing Axolotls before scooping them up with a bucket won't unleash the axolotl

- When a mob is left with only one heart and is simultaneously struck by an Instant Health Potion and an Instant Damage Potion, the mob becomes invincible. If the mob appears red and shaking, rejoining the game will restore its normal appearance
<br>


### Beta 1.17.0.54: (Android Exclusive Version, Requires Downgrading¹)
- Walls connect to Powder Snow 
<br>


### 1.17.10:
> [!CAUTION]
> PDV: End Portals give fall damage based on the player's y coordinate in the overworld. y=75 is enough to kill an unarmored player and y=100 is enough to kill anyone

- Waterlogging stairs or slabs and subsequently breaking them won't update the water, making it possible to create floating water

- Previously loaded chunks will get 64 bedrock layers if you turn on the "Caves and Cliffs" Experimental Toggle

- Support Blocks can be placed onto Candles

- Placing and picking up a Banner makes it Unstackable with crafted Banners

#### \* Picking up a Fish, or any other mob that can be scooped up, right as it dies, gives you a dead animal in a Bucket

- Placing an end crystal in the end and 2 pistons on different sides with their heads facing the end crystal, and activating them both at the same, will cause both to extend, leaving 2 piston heads in the same block

- Putting something on fire and breaking the block underneath while the game setting "Fire Spreads" is off will make the fire float and it won't distinguish. To see floating fire, you can use the Discontinued Feature Tweaks pack
<br>


### Beta 1.17.20.22: (Android Exclusive Version)
- Snow layers stay floating in mid-air if the block underneath is broken
<br>


### 1.17.32:
> [!CAUTION]
> PDV (1.17.30-1.17.40): A code change touched how the "autonomous entities list" worked and it wasn't getting cleared correctly. For example, if you would enter the end but not slay the dragon, it would be in this list. Then if you save and relog, the list would multiply by 2 everytime. This causes the world to use alot of memory and crash upon loading if the list for example has 2^18 dragons

- Support Blocks can be placed onto Light Blocks
<br>


### Beta 1.17.40.21: (Android Exclusive Version)
- Flowers in Meadows can replace blocks from structures like village houses, which can make Discontinued Block Formations
<br>


### 1.17.40:
- Pushing a button and subsequently breaking it with a silk touch tool will drop a pushed button. Stacking pushed buttons with regular buttons will revert them 
<br>


### Beta 1.18.0.24: (Android Exclusive Version)
- Deep Warm Oceans can still naturally generate. Example: Seed: 704291340, Coordinates: -621, 82, 694. To make deep warm oceans distinguishable, you can use the Discontinued Feature Tweaks texture pack
<br>


### 1.18.0:
- Updating any world to this version will not generate anything below y=0 if there is no bedrock at y=0

- Placing walls underneath floating candles will make the walls fully strech

- Pushing piglins through a nether portal while they are trying to barter with the player will force them to put the item that was given to them into their offhand, making them dual wielding mobs

- Pushing a villager through a nether portal while it is holding something will make the villager permanently hold the item. Do not hold an item that the villager wants once it is permanently holding an item or else it will stop holding it

- Scaffolding at y=1 will not update and fall if there is no block below it

- Librarians only require a single Book and Quill instead of two 

- Cartographers offer bedrock-specific banner patterns (Bordure Indented, Field Masoned) or the Flower Charge banner pattern on their master level trade 

- Butchers have cooked beef, cooked rabbit, and cooked mutton trades 

- Journeyman Armorer do not trade diamonds for emeralds

- Novice Weaponsmiths do not trade Iron swords for emeralds

- Apprentice Weaponsmiths trade enchanted iron swords

- Journeyman Clerics sell 1 glowstone dust for 4 emeralds

- Fishermen Boat trades do not change the wood type based on villager biome type, allowing you to obtain fishermen with mismatched wood type boats

- Aquifers can generate with missing bits of water, one can be found on the seed -1119260051 at -23, 111, 63

- Spikes out of Dripstone Blocks can spawn on the surface

- Chunk blending can mess up structures, which can lead to things like half beds, floating gravity blocks or floating support blocks

- Structures like Ocean Ruins often spawn on land

- Some igloos can generate with Redstone Torches facing the wrong way. Example: Seed: 1235243567, Coordinates: 115 79 547

- Mountain generation breaks at 2.812.332 blocks away from 0, 0 and replaces everything within a Frozen Peaks or Stony Peaks biome, except Aquifers, with huge lava ravines. These Aquifers can stretch all the way down to lava height and be on top of the lava without updating it and turning it into Obsidian. An example can be found on the Seed: -1485667881, at 2891297 -49 9439. On certain iOS devices, Monolith-like terrain generates instead of Lava Ravines. These "Monoliths" can go up to the old world height limit, y=256
<br>


### 1.18.10:
- The third hotbar slot acts as another output slot while being in the Furnace UI. For instance, if you switch between two stacks of netherite scraps (rename one to be able to swap) in this slot, you will receive 128 XP per swap. By using an autoclicker, you can reach the maximum level using this glitch in approximately 10 hours. An autoclicker for PC and Android can be found in the Files folder

- It is possible to obtain villagers with incorrect trades, such as a fletcher with stone mason trades. To achieve this, follow these steps: First, place 20 beds, with 19 of them corresponding to one type of workstation and 1 bed with a different type of workstation. Next, bring 20 villagers to the area where you have set up the beds and workstations. Then you have to zombify all the villagers (for a 100% zombification rate, ensure you are in hard mode). Once they are zombified, you can cure them. If done correctly, one of the villagers should have incorrect trades. This occurs because the villager retains their profession after being zombified, but during the curing process, there is a brief moment when they can change professions before returning to their original state. Please note that this method does not guarantee a 100% success rate
<br>


### 1.18.12:
- Gravity Blocks will not fall down if they are placed directly above top snow

- Red & Brown Mushroom Blocks, Chorus Plants & Flowers, Iron & Gold Nuggets and Nether Bricks can be placed into the fuel slot in Furnaces

### Beta 1.18.10.24: (Android Exclusive Version, Requires Experimental Mode)
- Glow Lichen can be placed on top of Frog Eggs
<br>


### Beta 1.18.10.26 => Beta 1.18.10.22: (Android Exclusive Version, Requires Downgrading¹)
> [!CAUTION]
> Do not turn "keep app data" on when uninstalling Minecraft on Android because it may cause problems. Keeping it enabled will glitch your phone, which as a result won't let you download Minecraft anymore, forcing you to factory reset in the worst case scenario. If you have a PC, run the downgrade fixer in the files folder. If you don't have a PC, but you are on Android 11 or above, try using an app with wireless debugging capabilities and run "pm uninstall com.mojang.minecraftpe"
- Downgrading a cartographer with the globe pattern trade from 1.18.10.26 to 1.18.10.22 turns the trade into an empty trade

- Making a Banner with the Globe Pattern and downgrading to 1.18.10.22 turns the globe banner pattern on the banner into "item.banner.base.x", where "x" represents the color. Globe banners will keep the globe banner tag, which means they will revert to normal banners when upgrading back. To avoid this, simply place the banners down and break them. This will remove the globe banner tag and preserve the "item.banner.base.x" tag

#### ** - Previously placed frog spawn will turn into unknown blocks, storing the old "minecraft:frog_egg" id

### 1.18.30:
> [!CAUTION]
> PDV: World sizes may fluctuate. They can randomly increase exponentially, resulting in worlds with gigabytes of junk data
- All types of Torches, redstone dust, Glow Lichen and Walls can be placed or attached to Bells

- Placing blocks in the lowest subchunk of a dimension in the east or west quadrants and then reloading the dimension causes them to regenerate in a glitched or invisible state. To successfully execute this, the subchunk must be completely empty. After placing the desired blocks, either relog or switch dimensions, then return and break all the blocks. Relogging or switching dimensions again and returning will result in the blocks reappearing in their glitched form. This glitch can be used to create unique blocks like half-beds, invisible shulker boxes, and headless pistons. This also allows for the creation of different types of wall skulls based on the placement and orientation of the skulls. Placing a skull on the ground gives a Wither Skeleton Wall Skull, while placing them against a wall in certain cardinal directions results in various skulls: West yields a Creeper Wall Skull, South a Steve Wall Skull, North a Zombie Wall Skull, and East a Dragon Wall Skull
