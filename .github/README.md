# Discontinued Features Guide
<br>


## Contents

This repository is a guide to help you find and collect all the discontinued features in Minecraft. It covers **Java Edition**, **Bedrock Edition**, and **Legacy Console Edition**, with each edition having its own dedicated section:

- [Bedrock Edition](https://github.com/p12h4/DF-Guide/tree/main/Bedrock)
- Java Edition (WIP)
- [Legacy Console Edition](https://github.com/p12h4/DF-Guide/tree/main/LCE)

Each guide explains how to obtain all the discontinued features for that edition, along with the specific versions they are available in, and the order you need to switch between versions to collect them all.

## "Discontinued Feature": What is it?

A discontinued feature is something that was obtainable in an older version of Minecraft but was changed or made unobtainable in later versions. This can range from mobs whose max health is higher/lower than normal to items or blocks with otherwise unobtainable properties/block states.
